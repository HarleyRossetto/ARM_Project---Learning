The next step is to select the peripheral for the given pin, using the "Peripheral Multiplexing" 
registers. Each peripheral is given a letter from A-H. The TCC timers are listed as peripheral F. 
While there's one "Pin Configuration" register per pin, there's only one "Peripheral Multiplexing" 
registers for each odd and even pin pair. (So there are only half the number of "Periphal Multiplexing"
 registers). For example port pin PA21 (D7) is odd, this is paired with PA20 (D6), which is even.

Each "Peripheral Multiplexing" 8-bit register is split into two 4-bit halves, odd and even, 
with each half specifying the selected peripheral A-H. PORT_PMUX_PMUXO_F is used to set the 
odd port for peripheral F and PORT_PMUX_PMUXE_F to set the even port. To select a given PMUX 
register you specify the even pair divided by 2 (>> 1), as there are only half the number of 
"Peripheral Multiplexing" registers.

The datasheet states that there is an even and odd PUMUXn (8-bit) register based on the pin number (four bits per pin).

Each pin is by default controlled by the PORT as a general purpose I/O and alternatively it can be assigned to one of the peripheral functions A, B, C, D, E, F, G or H. To enable a peripheral function on a pin, the Peripheral Multiplexer Enable bit in the Pin Configuration register corresponding to that pin (PINCFGn.PMUXEN, n = 0-31) in the PORT must be written to one. The selection of peripheral function A to H is done by writing to the Peripheral
Multiplexing Odd and Even bits in the Peripheral Multiplexing register (PMUXn.PMUXE/O) in the PORT.

The PMUXn register describes the usage where the even/odd pins are treated as a pair with 16 alternate selections per pin possible.  

Bits 7:4 – PMUXO[3:0]: Peripheral Multiplexing Odd
These bits select the peripheral function for odd-numbered pins (2*n + 1) of a PORT group, if the corresponding PINCFGy.PMUXEN bit is one.

Bits 3:0 – PMUXE[3:0]: Peripheral Multiplexing Even
These bits select the peripheral function for even-numbered pins (2*n) of a PORT group, if the corresponding PINCFGy.PMUXEN bit is one.
